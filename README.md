Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joshua Pechan, a passionate Computer Science student at the Florida Institute of Technology, with a strong focus on software development, AI, and embedded systems. Iâ€™m currently working towards my Bachelorâ€™s degree (anticipated graduation in May 2026), with a consistent Deanâ€™s List record and a diverse set of skills in languages like C++, Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, and more.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've developed a variety of projects that highlight my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise:

Othello Game with AI: A fully playable Othello game with a graphical interface, featuring both a simple greedy AI and a more strategic Minimax-based AI opponent.

Chefpal: An Android app that generates custom recipes using the OpenAI API, designed to help users with ingredient exclusions (like allergens).

ESP8266 LED Web Server: A secure, optimized embedded web server built in C++, designed for resource-constrained environments with real-time observability features.

In addition to coding, I have hands-on experience as a Programming Instructor at Code Ninjas, where I helped over 100 students develop game-based projects and strengthen their coding fundamentals.

Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on innovative projects and am keen to contribute to the open-source community. Feel free to browse my repositories and reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential opportunities! ðŸš€

Let's build something great! ðŸ’»âœ¨
